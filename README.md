# sla
Unfortunately, the code files were lost. In this project, I tried to analyze the reduction in osomtra time, because this would affect the level of quality (we call it SLA) in our company.
The total inspection time is divided into only 6 stages. In this passage I analyzed only 2:
1. I wanted to know if it was possible to reduce the time while the examination is in the queue and waiting for the doctor to take it to work? And also due to what and in what time frame this reduction in time can occur.
2. I wanted to do the same with the decision-making stage, when the doctor directly conducts a remote examination and decides whether to allow or not allow the driver to work
